# Fusion Starter

A production-ready full-stack React application template with integrated Express server, featuring React Router 6 SPA mode, TypeScript, Vitest, Zod and modern tooling.

While the starter comes with a express server, only create endpoint when strictly neccesary, for example to encapsulate logic that must leave in the server, such as private keys handling, or certain DB operations, db...

## Tech Stack

- **PNPM**: Prefer pnpm
- **Frontend**: React 18 + React Router 6 (spa) + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS 3
- **Backend**: Express server integrated with Vite dev server
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **UI**: Radix UI + TailwindCSS 3 + Lucide React icons

## Key Features

## SPA Routing System

The routing system is powered by React Router 6:

- `client/pages/Index.tsx` represents the home page.
- Routes are defined in `client/App.tsx` using the `react-router-dom` import
- Route files are located in the `client/pages/` directory

For example, routes can be defined with:

```typescript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
  {/* ADD ALL CUSTOM ROUTES ABOVE THE CATCH-ALL "*" ROUTE */}
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>;
```

### Styling System

- **Primary**: TailwindCSS 3 utility classes
- **Theme and design tokens**: Configure in `client/global.css` 
- **UI components**: Pre-built library in `client/components/ui/`
- **Utility**: `cn()` function combines `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes

```typescript
// cn utility usage
className={cn(
  "base-classes",
  { "conditional-class": condition },
  props.className  // User overrides
)}
```

### Express Server Integration

- **Development**: Single port (8080) for both frontend/backend
- **Hot reload**: Both client and server code
- **API endpoints**: Prefixed with `/api/`

#### Example API Routes
- `GET /api/ping` - Simple ping api
- `GET /api/demo` - Demo endpoint  

### Shared Types
Import consistent types in both client and server:
```typescript
import { DemoResponse } from '@shared/api';
```

Path aliases:
- `@shared/*` - Shared folder
- `@/*` - Client folder

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm dev        # Start dev server (client + server)
pnpm build      # Production build
pnpm start      # Start production server
pnpm typecheck  # TypeScript validation
pnpm test          # Run Vitest tests
```

## Adding Features

### Add new colors to the theme

Open `client/global.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` and add new tailwind colors.

### New API Route
1. **Optional**: Create a shared interface in `shared/api.ts`:
```typescript
export interface MyRouteResponse {
  message: string;
  // Add other response properties here
}
```

2. Create a new route handler in `server/routes/my-route.ts`:
```typescript
import { RequestHandler } from "express";
import { MyRouteResponse } from "@shared/api"; // Optional: for type safety

export const handleMyRoute: RequestHandler = (req, res) => {
  const response: MyRouteResponse = {
    message: 'Hello from my endpoint!'
  };
  res.json(response);
};
```

3. Register the route in `server/index.ts`:
```typescript
import { handleMyRoute } from "./routes/my-route";

// Add to the createServer function:
app.get("/api/my-endpoint", handleMyRoute);
```

4. Use in React components with type safety:
```typescript
import { MyRouteResponse } from '@shared/api'; // Optional: for type safety

const response = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
const data: MyRouteResponse = await response.json();
```

### New Page Route
1. Create component in `client/pages/MyPage.tsx`
2. Add route in `client/App.tsx`:
```typescript
<Route path="/my-page" element={<MyPage />} />
```

## Production Deployment

- **Standard**: `pnpm build`
- **Binary**: Self-contained executables (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Cloud Deployment**: Use either Netlify or Vercel via their MCP integrations for easy deployment. Both providers work well with this starter template.

## Digital Product Store - Deployment & Security

### Security Features
- **No direct access**: Private products are stored outside the public directory.
- **Token-based downloads**: Each purchase generates a unique 32-character hex token.
- **Expiry**: Tokens expire automatically after 10 minutes.
- **File Validation**: Only images under 2MB are accepted for payment proof.
- **Sanitization**: Filenames are sanitized and randomized to prevent injection.

### Adding New Products
1. Upload your file to `private-products/[id]/filename`.
2. Update `server/data/products.json` with the new product info and `filePath`.
3. Add a QR code image to `public/qrcodes/[id].png`.

### Deployment Guide

#### Option 1: Vercel / Netlify
1. Connect your repository to Vercel/Netlify.
2. Set Environment Variables:
   - `FAMPAY_ID`: Your Fampay ID (e.g., `user@fam`).
   - `FAMPAY_SECRET`: A secret key for verification.
3. Build Command: `pnpm build`
4. Output Directory: `dist/spa` (Note: Ensure the server function is correctly configured for the cloud provider).

#### Option 2: Railway / Heroku
1. Create a new service and connect your repository.
2. Set Environment Variables as above.
3. Start Command: `pnpm start`
4. **Persistent Storage Warning**: Both Railway and Heroku use ephemeral file systems. Uploaded screenshots and `private-products` will be lost on restart. For production, use AWS S3 or similar for file storage.

### Manual Setup
1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm build`
3. Create `.env` file with `FAMPAY_ID` and `FAMPAY_SECRET`.
4. `pnpm start`
